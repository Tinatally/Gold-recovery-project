# Gold-recovery-project
About the project: Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.
The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.
The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.You need to: Prepare the data; Perform data analysis;Develop and train a model.

Summary Results: We checked that recoveries are calculated accurately. Using the training set, we calculated recovery for the rougher.output.recovery feature and
checked how the concentrations of metals (Au, Ag, Pb) change depending on the purification stage. We considered the total concentrations of all substances at different stages: raw feed, rougher concentrate, and final concentrate for abnormalities. Finally, we trained different models using cross-validation.
